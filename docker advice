To optimize your Docker build process for a speech recognition application where you want to avoid downloading the model every time you change the code, you can leverage Docker's build cache and layer ordering. Here's how you can do it:

1. Restructure your Dockerfile to separate the model download from the code copy. This way, the model layer will be cached and reused unless you specifically change the model download instructions.

2. Use multi-stage builds to keep your final image size smaller.

Here's an example of how you could structure your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM python:3.9 as builder

# Set up the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Download the model
RUN wget https://example.com/speech_recognition_model.pkl -O model.pkl

# Final stage
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app

# Copy installed dependencies from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages

# Copy the model from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/model.pkl .

# Copy your application code
COPY . .

# Run your application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

In this Dockerfile:

1. We first create a builder stage where we install dependencies and download the model.
2. Then, in the final stage, we copy the installed dependencies and the downloaded model from the builder stage.
3. Finally, we copy the application code.

This structure ensures that the model download step (which is likely time-consuming) is cached and only re-run if you change the download command itself. Changes to your application code will not trigger a re-download of the model.

To further optimize your builds, you can use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from your build context:

```
node_modules
tmp*
```

By keeping your build context small, you can speed up the build process and reduce the likelihood of cache invalidation.

Remember to order your layers from least likely to change to most likely to change. This way, you can maximize cache usage and speed up your builds.

[Build > Cache > Optimize cache usage in builds > Order your layers](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/optimize/#order-your-layers)

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce build times when you're only changing your application code, as the model download step will be cached and reused.
